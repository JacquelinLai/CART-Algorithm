## Week 3 (11/27 - 12/03) Development Log Feedback

### Overall Comments
Great job on achieving the planned goals for the week! It's good to see that you were able to make improvements to function performance and we are are glad you were able to resolve the issues with the test cases and and also modified the original test cases for showing performance on edge cases.
Finishing the final report and creating the presentation slides are crucial steps for wrapping up the project. Make sure to allocate sufficient time for polishing these.
